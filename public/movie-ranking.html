        <h1>Yash's All-Time Fav Movies!!!</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 all time favourite movies</h2>
        <hr />

        <h3>Interstellar</h3>
        <p>Nolan's finest movie ever, really defines how a good plot and character driven sci-fi movie can be made.

        <h3>Zodiac</h3>
        <p>Probably the best thriller I've ever watched. Slow-burn with a gradual unraveling of a very intruiging mystery. Great acting from everyone, and a very acccurate potrayal of how newsrooms and police departments work.</p>

        <h3>Your Name</h3>
        <p>Heart-wrenching movie that can act as the perfect gateway drug into the world of anime. How do the Japanese create such original stories around such basic human emotions such as love, hearbreak, sadness, loss, etc.???</p>
